International Speed Tests with International Link Locations selected from an Australian Perspective

Utilises speedtest-cli 2.1.3 with some modifications that removes IP from output, allowing logs to be uploaded straight to sites like pastebin with a somewhat reduced risk of identification.

Prerequisites:
Python 2.4 - 3.7

How to use:
wget https://github.com/Nimbon/InternationalSpeedTests/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip
cd InternationalSpeedTests-master
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh


------


Sadly this no longer works due to limitations in the locations request only returning 10 locations maximum...

I will need to rework the code to support the official Ookla speedtest.
